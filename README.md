# contourTexture
test - Nothing here yet.

Currently updating cornerContour.web to allow this, based on experiments with HyperKitGL, kitGL, trilateral, integrating to allow switching between shader programs.
Theoretically the work is all done but fiddly setting up with slightly different structuring, so still WIP.
